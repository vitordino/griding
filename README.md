# [WIP] griding

[![npm package][npm-badge]][npm] [![demo][demo-badge]][demo]

> **griding** is a set of react components to make grid layouts easier


### why

although there are — already — an infinite amount of grid packages (pure css, stylus/sass, react) i couldn't find one that fill my needs:

1. responsive gutters
2. customisable breakpoints
3. real *react-like* API
4. easy to compose styles (lib-agnostic)


### roadmap

- [ ] finish `<ThemeProvider/>`
- [ ] make [`emotion`](https://emotion.sh/) version
- [ ] make vanilla style version
- [ ] optimize build size
- [ ] props to handle alignments (?)
